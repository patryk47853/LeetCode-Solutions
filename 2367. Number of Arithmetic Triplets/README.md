### 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

* i < j < k,
* nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
* nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.

Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.
