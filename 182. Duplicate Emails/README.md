## It is my submission for the following LeetCode problem:

### 182. Duplicate Emails

Table: Person

<code>+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.</code>
 

Write an SQL query to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.
