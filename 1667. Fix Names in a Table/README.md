### 1667. Fix Names in a Table

Table: Users

<code>+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
In SQL, user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.</code><br>
 
Fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.
